# Laconia

### An MVC application written in plain PHP without libraries or frameworks

Laconia is a personal project created by Tania Rascia to learn the fundamentals of programming and modern web development from scratch. The main goals of the project are to learn MVC (Model View Controller) architecture, the OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) paradigm, routing, authentication, security, modern development practices, and how to tie it all together to make a functional web app. 

Laconia runs on PHP 7.2 and MySQL. It uses Composer to autoload classes and  configuration and utility files, as well as future tests through PHPUnit. Node.js is used to compile Sass to CSS via npm scripts. I utilized [Primitive](https://taniarascia.github.io/primitive), my Sass workflow, for the styles.

Please feel free to fork, use, comment, critique, suggest, improve or help in any way.

## Installation

View the [live site](https://laconia.site) or install a local copy with the instructions below.

### Install Apache, MySQL, and PHP

It is assumed you know how to install a LAMP stack. For macOS and Windows local development, I would recommend downloading [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) for a sandboxed environment. You can [set up virtual hosts](https://www.taniarascia.com/setting-up-virtual-hosts/).

If using MAMP, add MAMP to the PHP command line by adding this line to `.bash_profile`.

```bash
export PATH=/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php7.2.1/bin:$PATH
```

### Install Composer

[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is the standard in PHP for dependency management, class autoloading, and much more.

```bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```

### Set up server

Create a virtual host called `laconia.server`. The server should point to the `/public` directory. For me, `httpd-vhosts.conf` looks like this.

```apacheconf
<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot "/Users/tania/hosts/laconia/public"
    ServerName laconia.server
</VirtualHost>
```

### Run install script

- Run `php bin/install.php` in the root directory to initialize the database.
- Run `composer install` to autoload classes and configuration.
- Run `npm install` to allow use of Sass
- In order to run Sass, use `npm run sass`.

Laconia is all set up and ready to use!

## Project Structure

The entire program flows through `/public/index.php`, and the rest of the project is a directory above public.

```bash
laconia/        
  .git             # Git source directory
  assets/          # Uncompiled raw SCSS, JavaScript
  bin/             # Command line scripts
  config/          # Database credentials, utility helpers, and other configuration
  data/            # SQL database files
  node_modules/    # Node.js front end dependencies
  public/          # Publicly accessible files
      css/         # Compiled, ready-to-use styles
      js/          # Compiled, ready-to-use scripts
      index.php    # Main entry point for the entire application
  src/             # PHP source code
      controllers/ # Controller classes
      models/      # Model classes
      views/       # Views
  tests/           # Unit tests
  vendor/          # Composer files and 3rd party packages
  .gitignore       # Files to be ignored in the repository
  composer.json    # Composer dependency file
  install.php      # Database installation script
  LICENSE          # MIT License file
  package.json     # npm dependency file
  README.md        # Brief documentation
```

## Usage

In Laconia, you can register an account, log in, log out, reset your password, create and edit lists, and view public profiles.

- `/` - Index
- `/register` - Register a new user
- `/login` - Login to user account
- `/home` - Logged in home screen
- `/logout` - Logout of user session
- `/forgot-password` - Get a password reset link
- `/create-password` - Create a new password
- `/view-users` - View all users
- `/settings` - Edit user settings
- `/create` - Create a new list
- `/edit/:list_id` - Edit an existing list
- `/:username` - View public profile
- `/404` - Any not found redirects to 404.

## Testing

Laconia uses PHPUnit for unit testing. Tests will go in the `/tests` directory. For now, here is how to run a Hello, World! script.

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit ./tests/HelloWorldTest
```
